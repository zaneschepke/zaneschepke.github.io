title: About Me
---

My name is Zane Schepke, a software developer based in Michigan. 

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in various technical and software development 
roles for both large and small corporations. In these roles, I’ve observed that 
many corporations are either overtly or covertly self-serving, prioritizing 
quarterly reports, stock or token prices, bureaucratic preservation, or perceived virtue 
over creating the best products for the greatest number of users. 

I’m driven to create software for two reasons: to provide for my family and to add value 
to people. I believe every person is inherently valuable, a unique creation and 
reflection of God with a unique purpose, despite their contributions or circumstances. 
If humanity’s existence were a mere random happenstance, we would have no intrinsic worth. 
It is this belief that fuels my commitment to creating open-source software, where maximum 
transparency is in the best interests of users.
